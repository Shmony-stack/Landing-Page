# Landing-Page
Creating a landing page/website in TOP. This is a combination of the skills acquired through
the "Foundation" section. Basic HTML5, CSS, and Flexbox at this point. Once this page is
complete, I will have demonstrated my ability to basically make a simple webpage with a 
bit more style and more advanced features than the Recipes page. I've decided to make a band
fanpage much like the various music blogs and review sites I frequented as a kid/teen.

I'm largely following the images given, however deviating a little and trying to push myself
even though this is likely to be a challenge as is. The webpage won't be anything fancy or
production worthy necessarily but hoping its functional and generally pragmatic in its purpose.
My goals with the page are as follows:
-Follow the general layout given
-Improve my understanding of the Flexbox layout model
-Clickable Button which links to the Duster Bandcamp
-Sticky header and footer
-Create a pleasant to look at page with basic interactive functions (e.g. clickable links, quick and responsive,functional in all browsers)
